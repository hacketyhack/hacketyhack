h1. Hackety Hack (for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux)

!https://travis-ci.org/hacketyhack/hacketyhack.png?branch=master!:https://travis-ci.org/hacketyhack/hacketyhack

 Hackety Hack is a programming starter kit. It's an editor
 with helpful coding tools and built-in messaging (so you can
 pass scripts to friends easily.)

h2. This is 1.0!

All the major pieces are in place. Hooray! There are still some kinks to work out, though. Nobody's perfect! Please "file an Issue":http://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/issues if you find something.

h2. Building Hackety Hack

h3. Shoooes

H-ety H is built on "Shoes":http://github.com/shoes/shoes. So, you gotta get Shoes first. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE*

bq. Hackety Hack depends on features that are only in the latest version of Shoes, "Policeman." This is the third version of Shoes, there's also "Rasins," which was version 2. If you download Shoes 2, it won't work!

Now back to your regularly scheduled instructions.

There are two options to getting Shoes: download a pre-built version, or build it yourself! 

h4. Pre-assembled Shoes

You can try downloading the latest version of Shoes from the "Downloads Page":http://shoesrb.com/downloads on the Shoes website.

h4. Some-assembly-required Shoes

If you like living on the bleeding edge, or there isn't a Shoes made for your platform, you can check out the "Building Shoes":http://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes page to find out how to build Shoes on your platform.

h3. 'Got Shoes Strapped on my Feet

Once you've got yourself a pair of Shoes, you'll want to fork me, then clone your repo:

bq.   $ git clone git@github.com:YOURUSER/hacketyhack.git 

If you've got your 'shoes' environment variable set, you can just run Hackety directly:

bq.   $ cd hacketyhack
   $ ./h-ety-h.rb

Otherwise, pick 'h-ety-h.rb' from the "Open an App." menu in Shoes.

You can also run 'shoes h-ety-h.rb' or if you're on a Mac, something like ' /Users/steveklabnik/Documents/src/shoes/Shoes.app/Contents/MacOS/shoes h-ety-h.rb' from the terminal.

h2. Building an installer

If you want to build Hackety Hack as a standalone app with the installer for your platform, you need to have your own Shoes built. Then, get your directories lined up...

bq.   $ ls
    shoes hacketyhack

And rebuild shoes, while pointing the APP flag at your Hackety directory:

bq.   $ cd shoes
   $ rake APP=../hacketyhack
   $ rake APP=../hacketyhack installer

That's it!

    vision, Hackety Hack would have never been born. Hopefully
